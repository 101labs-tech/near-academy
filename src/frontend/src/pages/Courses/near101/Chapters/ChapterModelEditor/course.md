*You are in the year 2029, the new internet is running on top of public interoperable blockchains. It seems crazy to think how the perception towards these technologies has drastically changed. The Internet of Value is more tangible than ever. Knowing how blockchain infrastructure works is not considered a competitive advantage nowadays. It is a must have.* 
*This chain of thoughts makes you remember the day when you originally discovered you could add a payment gateway with a 1-liner of code to your app via the NEAR Blockchain. This was such a game changer back then....* 

**Web3 Industry is rising - an overview**
Adding a blockchain-enabled payment gateway is as seamless as it can be, already today. 
The rise of the first blockchain application started in 2009 with Bitcoin, an independent network powering a global digital currency. The rise of Blockchain technology across many new applications now propel the Open Web Industry, known as Web3. In 2021, there are over 7,000 companies involved in building the next internet infrastructure of Web3.
The boom of blockchain and Web3 projects is fueling tremendous demand for software developers, engineers, testers, UX and web designers, project and community managers. Opportunities are everywhere. 

Blockchain isn’t just about financial transactions. Social and community tokens, for example, power new types of blockchain applications centered around human networks and the growth of these networks. They can be designed in a way to create shared-value for communities with community rules, leveraging the most enticing aspects of Web3 with new narratives around adoption, viral marketing, and ownership. For example, platforms such as rally.io let creators use blockchain to launch their own “creator coin”. Fans can be given, buy, donate, or hold onto creator coins. In this emerging space, we see tokens being used to raise capital, to incentivize fans or members, or to give stakeholders a voice in their community. .

**Paradigm Shift - The Internet of Value**
Ok, you mentioned how Bitcoin kickstarted the web3 movement but what is the Open Web ?* "Open Web" components are reusable smart contracts that share state, making for easy composability of applications that still protect users' data. Whereas Open Finance is built on the permissionless movement of value, the Open Web further generalizes this openness to operate on all data.*If we conclude that the WWW has reshaped information flows and that the Web2 is revolutionizing connections, the Web3 will fundamentally change agreements and exchange of value in the broadest sense.* **HTTP of Value**
The Internet we have used so far doesn’t have a native mechanism to transfer what computer science refers to as state – the status of who is who, who owns what, and who has the right to do what. 

State is a key property for managing values. The ability to easily and efficiently transfer value independently has been at the heart of exchanges between humans over centuries. When Alice receives 1 shell from Bob, their states change. If you can’t hold the state of the Internet, you can’t transfer value without centralized institutions acting as clearing entities.
Bitcoin and similar blockchains introduced a method for each participant in a network to hold and transfer value in a digitally native format, without the need for trusted intermediaries. The consensus protocol is designed in a way that the network can collectively remember preceding events or user interactions.

**It’s just a natural evolution of the Internet: A Protocol for Value**
The internet we have today is based on the TCP-IP protocol. TCP(Transmission control protocol)/IP (Internet Protocol) enables the data packets to transmit with extreme reliability. TCP/IP transmits information by digitizing it and breaking it up into very small packets with address information across a distributed network.
Currently, however, most web-services utilize servers and databases in their direct control to process requests and provide information. This infrastructure is usually managed by an individual entity who treats all of their data processing like a black box: the request goes in, something happens, and the user receives an output. That is the magic of “the cloud”.

**Why decentralization matters**
Web3 is similar in principle to the “cloud-based” infrastructure that developers currently build applications on top of, except that the cloud is no longer controlled by a single company running a giant data center — that data center is actually made up of all the people around the world who are operating nodes on the decentralized network. Instead of a “company-operated cloud,” it's a “community-operated cloud.”
