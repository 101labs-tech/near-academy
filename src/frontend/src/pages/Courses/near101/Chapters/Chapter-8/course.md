The network is production-ready, enabling the development of high-quality dApps and services in record time.

**And the NEAR community is here to help.** It is a vibrant community, including hundreds of experienced blockchain engineers working on the usability improvements every day. The NEAR Collective, in particular, provides education and outreach efforts to show that this technology is not as hard as many think.
