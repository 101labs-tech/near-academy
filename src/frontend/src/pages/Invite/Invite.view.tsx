                    <p>NEAR Academy is free and it will always be.
                        For all our registered users, we thought that implementing a referral
                        system would be the most effective way to grow together.
                    </p>

                    <p>What can you expect from the Academyâ€™s referral system?
                        Some NEAR every time your referred friend claims the certificate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are currently still testing this feature.
                        You can collect rewards, but payouts are frozen for the first
                        two weeks to make sure that the system is operating as intended.
