                    <p>NEAR Academy is free and it will always be.
                        For all our registered users, we thought that implementing a referral
                        system would be the most effective way to grow together.
                    </p>

                    <p>What can you expect from the Academyâ€™s referral system?
                        Some NEAR every time your referred friend claims the certificate.
                    </p>

                            For each newly registered user that finishes the NEAR Academy you will get 3 NEAR</p>

                    <p>
                        Simply share your link! During the registration process,
                        the Referral ID will be automatically filled with your username -
                        this way is faster for your friends and family to sign up!
                    </p>

                    <p>There is another way to increase your NEAR rewards:
                        by openly contributing to our repo on github</p>
